      <p>
Coding practices should be in place to maintain a consistancy among software 
projects to enforce a disciplines which improves the quality of software,
improves reuseability due to more generic interfaces and good documentation,
results in software with fewer bugs which is easier to use and maintain. 
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>File Names:</strong>
          <ul>
    <li>There should be one include file for each source code file.
Each include file should describe a single class or tightly integrated
set of classes. The general guideline is for include (.h and .hpp)
files to contain definitions and NOT instantiations. Thus the include
file can be used in multiple files. The source file (.C or .cpp)
defines code which when compiled gets loaded into memory. It
instantiates definitions defined in the include file. For example, a
class definition would be contained in the ".hpp" include file. A global
variable would be instantiated in the ".cpp" file and NOT the ".hpp"
file. This is because the global variable would be defined more than
once if the include file was used more than once. An "extern" statement
is appropriate for an include file as it does not declare memory for
the variable but just recognises its existance.</li>

    <li>File name should reflect the class name. While the class name typically starts with a capital letter, the include file and source files typically begin with lower case letters. i.e. file <tt>classBase.hpp</tt> will contain the definition of <tt>ClassBase{}</tt> and <tt>classBase.cpp</tt> will contain the source code to it's functions.</li>

    <li>Class names should follow the following format: <tt>CXxClassID</tt> where
        "Xx" refers to the component. (i.e. Mn main, Fm File manager, Cp command processor)
        The first character of each word shall be capitalized. Leave off the "C" prefix when naming the file.</li>

    <li>When referring to an include file within either another include file or 
        source file, do NOT include the full path. 
        This avoids portability problems created by operating system dependent
        methods of referencing directory paths.
        Use compiler command line flags to include the path. (i.e. -I/<i>path-name</i>)</li>

    <li>Use double quotes ("") for all project include files and angle chevrons 
        (&lt;&gt;) for include files provided by the operating system or 
        compiler.</li>

    <li>If burning ISO CD's, remember it is limited to file names of up to 30
        characters.</li>

    <li>To ease use with scripts and make files, file names 
        (and directory paths) should not contain
        blanks, parentheses "(", or crazy characters not supported by a majority
        of operating systems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>File formats:</strong> 
            <ul>
            <li>Line termination: For cross platform development, keep the "^M" line terminator out of files. They can be removed by the following:
               <ul>
               <li>Command: <tt>dos2unix filename.cpp</tt>
               <li>In vim: <tt>:1,$ s/{ctrl-V}{ctrl-M}//</tt>
               </ul>
               The "^M" can be kept out of the file using CM file property directives: <tt>svn propset svn:eol-style LF filename</tt>
               <br>For more see the YoLinux.com <a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/Subversion.html">Subversion tutorial</a>.
            </li>
            <li>If using MS/Visual studio, add a blank line at the end of the file with at least one blank space as this IDE may remove the perceived Unix "end-of-file" marker (ctrl-D). For more see the YoLinux.com <a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/MicrosoftVisualC++Tips.html">MS/Visual C++ best practices guide</a>.
            <p>
            </p>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>File headers:</strong>
          <ul>
          <li>File headers should include copyright statements, distribution licensing
        references and reflect corporate practices. 
        For example, if source code is released under the GNU license it should
        be stated as such. If the file contains corporate proprietary material,
        it should be stated as such. The segragation of such code into separate
        files is very important if the licensing, release practices for the file
        or copyrights are different.</li>

          <li>Comments shall be placed at the top of each file stating the name of the file
        and comments on the file contents. Comments should be directed towards the 
        users of the class contained in the file.
              <br>
        See below: <a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialC++CodingStyle.html#HEADERCOMMENTS">File Header Comments</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Header files:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li> C++ header files often use the suffix ".hpp" while "C" header files use ".h" suffix.
            </li>
            <li> Use the preprocessor to check for multiple inclusions.

            <li>Reduce the number of <tt>#include</tt> files in header files. 
                It will reduce build times. Instead, put include files in source code files and use forward declarations in header files.
                If a class in a header file does not need to know the size of a data member class or does not need to use the class's members then forward declare the class instead of including the file with <tt>#include</tt>.
                To avoid the need of a full class declaration, use references (or pointers) and forward declare the class.
              <dl>
              <dd>
              Example of forward declaration:
              <table bgcolor="#000000" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
                  <tbody>
                  <tr bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
                    <td>

              </table>
              </dd>
              </dl>
              <font color="#ff0000">[Potential Pitfall]</font>:
              STL collections (like <tt>std::list</tt> and <tt>std::vector</tt>) and typedefs can not use forward declarations and thus <tt>#include</tt> must be used.
            </li>

            <li>If C functions will be called from C++, then C include files will use the following declaration:
            <dl>
            <dd>
              <table bgcolor="#000000" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
                  <tbody>
                  <tr bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
                    <td>
                    <pre class="brush: cpp">
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
...
..
C function declarations
..
...
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
                  </pre>
                  </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
            </dd>
          </dl>
          </li>

          <li>Avoid the use of "namespace" in the ".hpp" include file. If
the file is included in source code the programmer may no longer use
variables defined in the namespace and may experience variable name clash.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Classes and Structs: </strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Standard practice is for class and struct definitions to begin with a capital letter. Base classes will often have the suffix "Base" appended to the class name. Be sure to add <tt>virtual</tt> (not pure virtual thus not "=0") to the base class destructors so both destructors are called.
            </li>

            <li>Example Class contents:
            <dl>
            <dd>
              <table bgcolor="#000000" border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1" width="100%">
                  <tbody>
                  <tr bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
                    <td>
                    <pre class="brush: cpp">

{
  public:

          </dl>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          </p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Machine dependent code</strong> shall, if possible, be placed in a separate file so that 
it may ease porting  tasks.
        <p>
        </p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Functions/subroutines:</strong> 
            <ul>
            <li>Length: It makes no sense to set a
rule or hard limit on the length of a function. A human should be able
to fully understand the complexity of a single function. If one can't,
then it needs to be broken down into a smaller understandable size. It
makes no sense to break a 3000 line function into smaller components if
all it consists of is a massive case/switch statement which can be
grasped upon first viewing. Complex algorithms should be broken up into
understandable units and may be too long at 50 lines of code. Thus the
length of a function requires common sense more than a rule which sets
a hard limit.
            </li>
            <li> List functions in ".cpp" file in the same order in which they are declared in the ".hpp" class declaration.
            </li>
            <li>Names: Use complement names for complement functions: get/set,
add/remove, create/destroy, start/stop, insert/delete,
increment/decrement, begin/end, first/last, up/down, min/max,
next/previous, open/close, show/hide, suspend/resume, etc.</li>
            </li>
            <li>Use keyword "<tt>const</tt>" to indicate that a variable or function parameter does not change.
            </li>
            </ul>
        <p>

        <li><strong>Use of case:</strong>
          <ul>
          <li>Use capital leters with an underscore used to separate words
        for macro constants and enumerations.</li>

          <li>Use a single capital letter to denote the start of a new word in the
        variable, class or function name.
              <br>
Example: <tt>thisIsAnExample</tt>
        </li>
        <li>Function names should begin with a lower case letter.</li>

        <li>Class definitions begin with a capital letter. The "C" prefix is 
        "Hungarian" notation as noted below. The instantiation should begin with
        a lower case letter. 
        <br>
Example:  <tt>CAbcXyz abcXyz</tt></li>

        <li><strong>Formatting of C++ sytax:</strong> Various existing syntax styles have been defined for corporate and open source projects including the Linux kernel ("C") itself. 
            Some corporate styles such as <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/cplus/c++.rules/">Ellemtel</a> and others have been incorporated into the Emacs editor as an option.
            See the <a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialXemacs.html">YoLinux.com Emacs tutorial</a> and the "beautify" feature. Here are some of my favorites:
            <ul>
            <li>Operators should have a space on wither side of them: <tt>+, -, &lt;. &gt;, =, ==, ...</tt>
            <li>Use spaces for indentation. Don't use tabs as different IDEs and editors may treat them differently. Also see the <a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/MicrosoftVisualC++Tips.html">YoLinux.com MS/Visual C++ best practices</a> tutorial to avoid cross platform pitfalls.</li>
            </li>
            <li>Break up long Boolean expressions and parameter lists onto 
                separate lines with appropriate indentation for alignment.

      <p>
Camel-case is the practice of changing the letter to upper case to denote
the start of a new word. This allows the name to be shorter because no
separator character (i.e. "_" used between words.)
The Camel-case practice uses a "_" separator between upper case constants used in words.

"Hungarian" prefixes: Some of these are discussed in the book "Code Complete"
and others I have seen in corporate coding standards. While these are prefixes
(beginning of name) I have also seen some used as suffixes (end of name).

for class member static variables. (Also "m" and "ms" for member and
member-static) I have also seen the use of "_" as both a prefix and as
a suffix to denote a class member variable. If using mixed languages
remember that many FORTRAN compilers use a "_" suffix. Due to C++ name
mangling there will probably be no conflict when using this notation.
It is a common practice but theoretically could pose a problem with
mixed languages. See <a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialMixingFortranAndC.html">Mixing FORTRAN and C</a> YoLinux tutorial.</td>

Hungarian Examples:
      <br>

      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>ppach<i>VarName</i>: pointer to a pointer of an array of characters.</li>

        <li>m_ppach<i>VarName</i>: class member variable which is a pointer to a pointer of an array of characters.</li>

      </ul>
The use of "Hungarian" should make the code more readable and NOT more
complicated so use it wisely and consistently. Many corporate standards
will choose a subset of the above. eg. m, _, g, s, e, b, i, n.

      <b>dOxygen:</b> cross-platform, JavaDoc-like documentation system
for C++, Java, C, and IDL. DOxygen is included with the base release of
most Linux
distributions including Red Hat and SuSE. DOxygen tags support two
basic format styles, \<i>tagname</i> or @<i>tagname</i>. The later is the Javadoc style which is shown in this tutorial.

an overwhelming number of references.

      <h3>dOxygen and C++ STL:</h3>

When used in conjunction with Graphviz, dOxygen will generate small UML class
diagrams embeded within the documentation. 
There are two methods to support inclusion of C++ STL:
<ul>
<li>Include a STL definitions file so dOxygen can display inheritance diagrams which include STL. Place the
file <a href="http://ilab.usc.edu/toolkit/doc-nosrc/html/d2/d30/dummySTL_8H_source.html">dummySTL.H</a> [<a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/src/dummySTL.H">cached</a>] 
in the directory with your source code before running dOxygen. 
No references are required within your code. DOxygen will read the file and
use its definitions to display a more complete class diagram.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>Turn on the built-in support for C++ STL:

      <h3>dOxygen and C++ STL:</h3>

When used in conjunction with Graphviz, dOxygen will generate small UML class
diagrams embeded within the documentation. 
There are two methods to support inclusion of C++ STL:
<ul>
<li>Include a STL definitions file so dOxygen can display inheritance diagrams which include STL. Place the
file <a href="http://ilab.usc.edu/toolkit/doc-nosrc/html/d2/d30/dummySTL_8H_source.html">dummySTL.H</a> [<a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/src/dummySTL.H">cached</a>] 
in the directory with your source code before running dOxygen. 
No references are required within your code. DOxygen will read the file and
use its definitions to display a more complete class diagram.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>Turn on the built-in support for C++ STL:

Peer review of code during the developemnt process is a healthy step for 
the empowerment of communication within the software team and is a step  to promote software source code quality. Peer reviews should look for:
<ul>
<li>Header: license and/or copyright information.</li>
<li>Comments: adequate explanation, units of measurement. Use of dOxygen tags: comments for each function, function arguments (in/out), ...</li>
<li>Adherance to coding standards: variable naming, indentation, bracket style, ...</li>
<li>Use of standard APIs: Don't reinvent and add code maintenance.</li>
<li>Use of standards: file format standards (i.e. log file formats), ISO or ANSI standards.
<li>Error checking and handling. Data integrity checks: range checks. </li>
<li>Resource leaks: memory, database connections, files, sockets, ...  freed for each logic path including error handling.
    <br>(See the <a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/C++MemoryCorruptionAndMemoryLeaks.html">YoLinux.com memory corruption and memory leaks tutorial</a>)</li>
